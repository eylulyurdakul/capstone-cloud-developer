# Serverless TODO with Image Upload Functionality

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item has an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# TODO items

The application should store TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item

# Functions to be implemented

The following functions are implemented and configured in the `serverless.yml` file:

* `Auth` - this function implements a custom authorizer for API Gateway that should be added to all other functions.

* `GetTodos` - returns all TODOs for a current user. A user id is extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend

It returns data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "todoId": "123",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Buy milk",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": false,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
    {
      "todoId": "456",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Send a letter",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": true,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
  ]
}
```

Necessary resources are added to the `resources` section of the `serverless.yml` file such as DynamoDB table and S3 bucket.

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API.

This frontend works with the serverless application. The `config.ts` file in the `client` folder configures the client application and contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

## Authentication

To implement authentication in your application, you would have to create an Auth0 application and copy "domain" and "client id" to the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. We recommend using asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.

# Best practices

Logging is implemented to follow the best practices.

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection, do the following.

Click on the import button:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-1.png?raw=true "Image 1")


Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true "Image 2")


Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true "Image 3")


Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true "Image 4")

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):

![Alt text](images/import-collection-5.png?raw=true "Image 5")
